# MedEx Chatbot PHI Protection Architecture

## üö® CRITICAL: ZERO PHI ACCESS

The MedEx chatbot is **COMPLETELY ISOLATED** from all patient data and Protected Health Information (PHI).

## Technical Architecture

### What the Chatbot IS:
- A **navigation assistant** that helps users understand how to use the MedEx platform
- A **feature guide** that explains system capabilities and workflows
- A **settings helper** that provides instructions for configuration

### What the Chatbot IS NOT:
- ‚ùå NOT connected to any patient database
- ‚ùå NOT able to retrieve call records, SMS messages, or patient information
- ‚ùå NOT able to access Supabase tables containing PHI
- ‚ùå NOT able to query or display any healthcare data

## Implementation Details

### Service Architecture (`simpleChatService.ts`)
```typescript
class SimpleChatService {
  // ONLY connects to OpenAI API
  // NO Supabase connection
  // NO database queries
  // NO patient data access

  async sendMessage(userMessage: string) {
    // Takes user question
    // Sends to OpenAI with system prompt
    // Returns general guidance ONLY
    // ZERO database access
  }
}
```

### No Database Access
The chatbot service has:
- ‚ùå No import of `supabase` client
- ‚ùå No import of any data services (callsService, chatService, etc.)
- ‚ùå No database connection strings
- ‚ùå No API endpoints that retrieve patient data
- ‚ùå No access to localStorage containing PHI

### System Prompt Protection (First Priority)
The chatbot's system prompt begins with:

```
üö® CRITICAL PHI PROTECTION - READ THIS FIRST üö®

ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION - NO EXCEPTIONS:
You have ZERO access to any Protected Health Information (PHI),
patient data, or healthcare records. You are COMPLETELY ISOLATED
from all patient databases and medical information systems.
```

### User-Facing Warning
The welcome message explicitly states:
```
IMPORTANT: I have NO access to patient data or PHI.
I can only help with general platform features and navigation.
```

## What Users Can Ask

### ‚úÖ ALLOWED Questions:
- "How do I navigate to the Dashboard?"
- "Where can I find my settings?"
- "How do I set up MFA?"
- "What features does MedEx have?"
- "How do I configure email notifications?"
- "What do the different roles mean?"
- "How do I export a report?"

### ‚ùå PROHIBITED Questions:
- "Show me patient John Doe's records"
- "What calls did I receive yesterday?"
- "Display SMS messages from phone number XXX"
- "What is the diagnosis for patient ID 123?"
- "Show me the last call transcript"

### Chatbot Response to PHI Requests:
```
"I cannot access any patient data or Protected Health Information (PHI).
I can only help with general platform navigation and features.
For patient information, please use the Dashboard, Calls, or SMS pages directly."
```

## HIPAA Compliance

### Why This Is Compliant:
1. **Complete Isolation**: No technical ability to access PHI
2. **Explicit Instructions**: System prompt prohibits PHI discussion
3. **User Warning**: Users informed of limitations upfront
4. **No Logging**: Chatbot conversations don't log patient data (because it can't access it)
5. **Aggregated Data Only**: Can only discuss general statistics (e.g., "total calls"), never individual records

### Audit Trail:
- Chatbot has NO access to audit_logs table
- Cannot retrieve user login history
- Cannot access call/SMS records
- Only provides general guidance

## Technical Verification

### File: `src/services/simpleChatService.ts`
- ‚úÖ No database imports
- ‚úÖ No Supabase client usage
- ‚úÖ No patient data retrieval
- ‚úÖ Only OpenAI API calls

### File: `src/components/common/SiteHelpChatbot.tsx`
- ‚úÖ No database imports
- ‚úÖ No data service imports
- ‚úÖ Only UI rendering and message handling
- ‚úÖ Warning message displayed to users

## Conclusion

The MedEx chatbot is **architecturally incapable** of accessing PHI. It is not connected to any databases, does not import any data services, and has explicit prohibitions in its system prompt.

**This is a navigation assistant, not a data assistant.**
