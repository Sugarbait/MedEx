## ðŸ§¾ Invoice Generation (Dashboard Page)

### Location
**Page**: Dashboard
**Button**: "Generate Invoice" (top right, green button with DollarSign icon)

### How It Works
1. Click "Generate Invoice" button
2. Modal appears showing:
   - Selected date range
   - Total amount (CAD)
   - Customer email and name
3. Click "Generate Invoice" to show confirmation
4. Click "Confirm & Send" to generate

### What Happens
1. **Creates Stripe Invoice**:
   - Uses `VITE_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `VITE_STRIPE_CUSTOMER_ID`
   - Adds line items for Voice Calls and SMS
   - Finalizes invoice with 30-day payment terms

2. **Generates Dashboard PDF**:
   - Exports current dashboard report with MedEx logo
   - Uploads to temporary storage
   - Includes in email as download link

3. **Sends Professional Email**:
   - Calls Supabase Edge Function `send-invoice-email`
   - Sends to `elitesquadp@protonmail.com`
   - Email matches ARTLEE styling with MedEx branding

4. **Saves to Database**:
   - Invoice stored in `invoices` table
   - Synced across devices via Supabase
   - Available in Invoice History
